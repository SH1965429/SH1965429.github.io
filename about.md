# About Me
Hello! I am SH1965429.
I am very smart and kind. I have a lot of friends because I am nice to everyone and I always make people feel welcome. I love the color pink and I love the minion movies. I draw and bake when im bored. I can be both introvert and extrovert.

My top career is being an entrepreneur. I want to be an entrepreneur because i dont want to have to work for nobody else and I can make a business doing something I like so I can enjoy work. It connects to my life style goals because I am the eldest which means I have to be more mature and responsible. i am also very independant, intelligent, I have great communication, and I'm mature enough to see other peoples perspectives while being respectful and learn from mistakes to improve myself. These skills I have will make me understand more and be able to do my work.
